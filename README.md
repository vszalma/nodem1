Here is my submission for module 1. I took a relatively simplistic approach. I just read the input file into a variable with readFileSync, call the csvjson nodule to convert to JSON with default options, then write the JSON results with writeFileSync.

I tested this and everything worked as expected. I also wrote out the total bytes to the log just to validate that things were working as expected.
